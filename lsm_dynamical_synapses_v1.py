        # In the model proposed by Tsodyks and Markram (Tsodyks 98), the STD effect is 
        # modeled by a normalized variable x (0≤x≤1), denoting the fraction of resources 
        # that remain available after neurotransmitter depletion. The STF effect is modeled 
        # by a utilization parameter u, representing the fraction of available resources ready 
        # for use (release probability). Following a spike, (i) u increases due to spike-induced 
        # calcium influx to the presynaptic terminal, after which (ii) a fraction u of available 
        # resources is consumed to produce the post-synaptic current. Between spikes, u decays 
        # back to zero with time constant τf and x recovers to 1 with time constant τd.
        #
        # In general, an STD-dominated synapse favors information transfer for low firing rates, 
        # since high-frequency spikes rapidly deactivate the synapse
        # 
        # Since STP has a much longer time scale than that of single neuron dynamics (the latter is typically 
        # in the time order of 10−20 milliseconds), a new feature STP can bring to the network dynamics is 
        # prolongation of neural responses to a transient input.
        # 
        # The interplay between the dynamics of u and x determines whether the joint effect of ux is dominated by 
        # depression or facilitation. In the parameter regime of τd≫τf and large U, an initial spike incurs a large 
        # drop in x that takes a long time to recover; therefore the synapse is STD-dominated (Fig.1B). 
        # In the regime of τf≫τd and small U, the synaptic efficacy is increased gradually by spikes, and consequently 
        # the synapse is STF-dominated (Fig.1C). This phenomenological model successfully reproduces the kinetic 
        # dynamics of depressed and facilitated synapses observed in many cortical areas.
